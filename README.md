SwingCapture
============

A simple photo booth program. It was written hastily for a party. 

Dependencies
============

* Java 1.5 or later.
* [Java Media Framework](http://java.sun.com/javase/technologies/desktop/media/jmf/).
* A JMF-supported capture device.

Install
=======

The project is packaged with NetBeans project files. The easiest way to build
it is by using NetBeans tools. Though it really does not stop you from building
from the source however way you like.

However way you build it, just run the built jar, or the class
`swingcapture.Main` directly.
